             consumers of any product the opportunity to buy goods and services at unbeatable prices."


        p2:  "Indeed, in a global context where one of the characteristics is the upward pressure on prices,
              RINGMARKET on the blockchain will help pull prices down to allow consumers to retain
              their purchasing power."
